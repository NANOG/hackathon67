# hackathon67
The NANOG Hackathon will bring network operators together in a room to develop new ideas and hacks. Tools and software beyond those provided by vendors and existing open-source projects are needed to keep those networks up and running. Gather at NANOG 67 to collaboratively hack on code or hardware, develop ideas, and documentation.
